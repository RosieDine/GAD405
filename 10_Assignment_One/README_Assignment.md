# GAD405

10/11/2018: Possible ideas for generative art: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShxLEmrdlM inspired the idea that a canvas could use code to generate randomly coloured ellipses or rectangles to create the outline of any country across the globe. The starting point of a randomly selected country would also random.

Maybe a clock that changes appearance when interacted with? (mouse click, left and right, maybe middle too?)

Maybe a fractal tree that grows differently each time the code is run?

Maybe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1eIg54clGo something like this.

https://p5js.org/examples/3d-orbit-control.html 3D orbit control, maybe use this with random generations of shapes all around the user.

https://p5js.org/examples/input-keyboard.html I like this idea of keyboard input.

https://p5js.org/examples/dom-input-and-button.html I like the interactivity between the code and user and the results it can have. Maybe use this as a base to ask the user a few questions? The answers and results to each question would be displayed in a random font/colour on the canvas. maybe if they type something rude or not related to the question, a humorous alert would come up onto the screen]
