# GAD405

This assignment, appropriately named "Bubbles", was inspired by a sketch I found on a website, called "open processing",
named "Firefly"(https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/607764).

I have used several videos for inspiration, the main one a being a coding challenge by the user "The Coding Train"
on YouTube.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGS3fKPKJA). He explores the use of cell division, which is a primary
interaction I use for my sketch. However, I have managed to code the "cells" to separate in random directions and
at varying speeds. Additionally, I have created a section of code that places boundaries around the edge of the canvas, meaning the moving shapes will bounce in the opposite direction once they hit the maximum width or height of the window.
When stuck on any issues, I turned my attention to the examples page on the p5.js website. (https://p5js.org/examples/).

In my assignment sketch, two randomly placed and differently coloured ellipses will be drawn on the canvas and slowly move in varying directions. They will split into smaller, randomly coloured ellipses' when clicked on with the mouse function. This process can be repeated several times until the canvas is filled with multiple ellipse shapes. Any ellipse shapes
will bounce in the opposite direction once they have reached the maximum width or height of the canvas to give the user
the impression of physical boundaries in the window. The user can then refresh the webpage to restart the entire sketch.
