# GAD405

This assignment was inspired by a sketch I found on a website, called "open processing",
named "Firefly"(https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/607764).

I have used several videos for inspiration, the main one a being a coding challenge by the user "The Coding Train"
on YouTube.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGS3fKPKJA). He explores the use of cell division, which is a primary
interaction I use for my sketch. However, I have managed to code the "cells" to separate in random
directions

In my assignment sketch, two randomly coloured ellipse shapes will be drawn on the canvas and slowly move in different
directions
